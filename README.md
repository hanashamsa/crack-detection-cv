#  Crack Detection using Computer Vision (OpenCV)

This project implements a basic **image-processing-based crack detection system** using Python and OpenCV. It highlights surface cracks in input images using filters and edge detection a practical tool for inspecting walls, roads, or industrial surfaces for structural anomalies.

##  Features
- Grayscale conversion & blurring
- Canny edge detection for crack boundaries
- Output image with highlighted crack lines
- Modular Python script (easy to adapt)

##  How It Works
1. Load and convert the image to grayscale
2. Apply Gaussian blur to reduce noise
3. Use Canny edge detection to find contours
4. Display/save the processed image
